# Convolution Neural Networks Classifier

* Compiling CNN classifier with Adam optimizer taking Accuracy metric to monitor. 

* Use of Image Data Generator to generate testing data with common data augmentation techniques or training data from images stored in the directory structure. 

* Report generated on test data of 500 images. 
 
### Macro average=0.65 

* The model is modifiable by adding regularization to the layers, adding more convolutional layers, etc., to improve the testing accuracy.
